- 👋 Hi, I’m @hsavoldelli
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about coding. I've invested in over 100 vSaaS businesses and always want to learn as much as possible at the ground level. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about the code base for a modern saas business and how that's differentiated from the codebase of incumbents. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever you find interesting or productive in achieving the above goal. 
- 📫 How to reach me -- find me!
